# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple Bash script that calculates simple interest
based on user input.

The script asks the user to enter:
- Principal amount
- Rate of interest
- Time period

It then calculates the simple interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

This project is part of a Git and GitHub learning exercise and follows
